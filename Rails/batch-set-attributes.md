```ruby
user.attributes = {name: "Rob"}
```

This method will set all the attributes you pass it. The changes are not saved to the database. Any attributes you donâ€™t pass will be left unchanged. You can also use assign_attributes:

```ruby
user.attributes = {name: "Rob", age: 12}
user.assign_attributes {name: "Rob", age: 12}
```
These are equivalent
